## Crypto
`dcode` is a very useful tool for decrypting various ciphers.
`pycrptodome` is a successor of the no longer mained `pycrypto`

## Forensics
`hex editor` (like `xxd`) is useful to analyze (binary) contents of a file
`binwalk` allows to detect which type of a file a certain file is
`pillow` (python) analyze and edit images

## Privilege Escape
- linPEAS for automated checking
- to check which binaries you can run with sudo `sudo -l`
- use https://gtfobins.github.io to find instructions how to exploit this binary
- find SUID bit set using "find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null"

## Web
`Burp Suite` GUI tool to execute/modify HTTP requests
`requests` (python) sending requests in any format
`nikto` (https://github.com/sullo/nikto) for web server scanner
`bbot` (https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot) for web server scanner

## everse Engineering
`IDA Free` (statically) analyze binaries
`Ghidra` (statically) analyze programs

## Cracking hashes
Find hash type using https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes
Identify hashcat module for the hash type
`hashcat -m [module] hashes.txt wordlist.txt`
Or `hashcat -m [module] -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -o out.txt` (`-a 0` indicates we have a wordlist of potential passwords)

Or: https://crackstation.net/, https://hashes.com

## Pwn
`x64dbg` analyze a program at runtime
`pwndbg` is a `gdb` plugin that makes debugging suck less
`pwntools` (python imported via `pwn`) wide variety of tools for dealing with binaries. Also allows to connect to a TCP socket (aka netcat connection). [documentation](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/intro.html#making-connections) and [cheatsheet](https://xavierholt.github.io/cheatsheets/pwntools.html)
Use `https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-811.html` or `https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-606.html` for shell codes (also see diff ones from that website)

```
The binary operates with both a real user ID (UID) and an effective user ID (EUID). Certain shells, when spawned from the binary, will drop their privileges if they detect a mismatch between the UID and EUID. This behavior is a security measure to prevent unintended privilege escalation. To maintain elevated privileges in such cases, consider using a shell which does not automatically do this or pass an argument that prevents the shell from doing this.
