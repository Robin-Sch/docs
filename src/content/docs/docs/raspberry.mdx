Here are various commands/tools I use on my raspberry pi

## Static IP

Edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` and put the following content:

```
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=1.1.1.1
```

## Turn of lights

Edit `/boot/config.txt` and put the following content:

```
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=none
```

## Auto start browser on boot

Edit `~/.bashrc` and put the following content at the bottom:

```bash
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty* ]]; then
	startx /usr/bin/chromium https://docs.robinsch.net # --kiosk
fi
```

Use --kiosk for a more "full screen" experience

## Monitor CPU temperature

```bash
watch -n 1 vcgencmd measure_temp
```
