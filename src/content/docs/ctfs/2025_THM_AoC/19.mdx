title: Day 19: ICS/Modbus - Claus for Concern
---

## SCADA

Four key components:
1. Sensors and actuators: eyes and hands of the system
2. PLCs: brains
3. Monitoring systems: visual interfaces such as CCTV cams, dashboards and alarm panels
4. Historians: databases that store operational data

- Often run legacy software with known vulnerabilities. They were installed decades ago and never updated
- Default credentials are commonly left unchanged
- Designed for reliability, not security
- Controls important (physical) processes such as water supply
- Connectd to corporate networks
- Modbus protocol (often used) lacks authentication

## PLC

Designed to:
- Survive harsh environments
- Run continuously without failure
- Execute control logic in real-time
- Interface directly with physical hardware

## Modbus Protocol

Communication protocol that industrial devices use to talk to each other.

Very simple, can directly read/write from registers, which makes it easy to implement and debug. However, there is no authentication/authorization and no encryption. Anyone who can reach the Modbus port can read/write any value.

It has 4 distinct data types:
- Coils, digital outputs (0 or 1)
- Discrete inputs, digital inputs (0 or 1)
- Holding registers, analogue outputs (0-65535)
- Input registers, analogue inputs (0-65535)

The difference between input and output is important. Outputs are writable, changing their values means controlling the system. The inputs are read-only and reflect sensor measurements.

Each data point has an unique address.
