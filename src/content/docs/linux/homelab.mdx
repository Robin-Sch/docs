Below is a list of useful things that I use/need

## Encrypted external disk

Without storing the password on the boot drive, the external encrypted disk can not be mounted after (re)booting. This means that the contents of the disk are unavailable until a manual intervention.

This results in folders that are shared via samba/NFS to become unavailable and folders that are synced using [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to get messed up (if they are auto started).

Create `~/start-samba.sh` and put the following content:
```bash
disk=/dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXXX # get from `sudo blkid`
cryptname=cryptdisk
mountpoint=/media/cryptdisk

sudo cryptsetup open $disk $cryptname
sudo mkdir -p $mountpoint
sudo mount /dev/mapper/$cryptname $mountpoint && sudo systemct start smbd && sudo systemctl start nfs-server && sudo systemctl start syncthing@pi
```

Edit `/lib/systemd/system/syncthing\@.service` and put the following:
```
ConditionPathIsMountPoint=/media/cryptdisk
```

## Samba

To create a new samba user:
```bash
sudo adduser --no-create-home --disabled-password --disabled-login robin
sudo smbpasswd -a robin
sudo passwd robin
```

### Mounting over tailscale

Edit `/etc/fstab` and put the following:
```
//100.64.0.XXX/YYY /media/YYY cifs username=user,password=pass,uid=user,gid=user,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.requires=tailscaled.service,x-systemd.idle-timeout=60,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30 0 0
```

## Disable screen/tty output

I have connected my mini pc to one of my monitors (to watch movies/series via Kodi) that I also use for my desktop pc.
As my mini PC is running 24/7, the monitor might pick the signal from the mini pc instead of my desktop pc, when I want to use my desktop instead (and I am too lazy to press the button on the monitor to change source).


I first tried putting `consoleblank=60` in `/etc/default/grub` and afterwards running `update-grub`. This worked (after rebooting) but once I started Kodi it no longer goes off. So Instead I just run the script below after I am done watching:

```bash
# https://www.armadeus.org/wiki/index.php?title=Framebuffer#Sleep

echo "Trying kill output after 1 min"
echo -e '\033[9;1]' | sudo tee -a /dev/tty1
```

## Sound over HDMI (headless install)

To get sound to work I used the following:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G robin
aplay -l # find out card (probably 0) and device (brute force)

speaker-test --channels 2 --test wav --device hw:[card],[device]
pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:[card],[device]

pactl list sinks # find sink
pacmd set-default-sink [sink_name/sink_index]

systemctl --user enable --now pulseaudio
```

## Wireguard

For multi hop see https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2022/06/multi-hop-wireguard/#internet-gateway-as-a-spoke

### Bypass UDP block

Some networks block UDP packets meaning you can not connect to wireguard. You can instead connect to `serverip:53` and put the following in your server's wireguard config (where `XXX` is the port you are listening on, e.g. 51820):

```
PostUp = iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp -m multiport --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports XXX
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp -m multiport --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports XXX
```

### Proxying from public into a private/hidden server

For example, hosting a service on a device inside your home network but make it accessible by anyone using `serverip:xx`

```
PreUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport xx -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.200:xx
PreDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport xx -j DNAT --to-destination 10.10.0.200:xx
PreUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wg0 -j MASQUERADE
PreDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o wg0 -j MASQUERADE
```

## Get shell access without recovery/chroot

As long as grub is working, you can edit the entry and add `init=/bin/bash` at the end of the line starting with `linux`.

Then, you can make the root filesystem read-write (intead of read only) using `mount -o remount,rw /`.

After that you can setup networking (if needed), using either `dhclient` or manually:
```
ip a add IP/24 dev eth0
ip link set eth0 up
ip route add default via GATEWAY
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

Make sure to replace `IP` with the IP of your device and GATEWAY with the IP of your gateway
